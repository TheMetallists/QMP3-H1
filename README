QMP3-H1 - is a GUI decoder of weather baloon telemetry.
Based on work of zilog80 github user, but transformed into Qt GUI application that can be build for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and probably mobile devices.

Takes flat audio from SDR software or hardware receivers, can produce CSV output that can be converted to GPX afterwards.
I have a simple CLI utility for that, but if this decoder will get popular I'll add GPX support to the software itself.


LINUX USERS:
I've had this software built for linux using QT5, but now I can't upload a binary release.
I'll do this later, so to build sources you've to install a qt5 build package from your distro's repo or directly from https://qt.io - choose the opensource online installer version.

WINDOWS USERS:
Tested, binary release provided.

MAC USERS:
Has not tested, i've no apple PC.

ANDROID & IOS:
Qt can produce mobile platform executables, but they will require additional work.
If enough users will write comments into Issues tab, I will create a build.

ENGLISH/RUSSIAN USERS:
This app's interface is written in a mix of those two languages.
If you want a complete correct translation - again, file an Issue.
